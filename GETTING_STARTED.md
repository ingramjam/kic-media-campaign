## ⚠️ Critical Path Reminders

**THESE DATES ARE CRITICAL - DO NOT MISS THEM**

1. **December 15** - Music composition MUST start
   - If missed → All video delays by 5-10 days
   - Mitigation: Have stock music backup ready

2. **December 23-25** - Talent shoots MUST happen
   - If missed → Post-production compressed, quality suffers
   - Mitigation: Alternate dates 12/26-27 (weekend) as last resort

3. **January 5** - Video editing MUST be complete
   - If missed → Cannot launch on 1/9
   - Mitigation: Hire freelance editor if James overloaded

4. **January 8** - Assets MUST be uploaded
   - If missed → 24-hour emergency upload window
   - Mitigation: Upload Wed morning for contingency

5. **January 9** - PHASE 1 LAUNCH
   - If delayed → Lose New Year timing momentum
   - Mitigation: Have backup ad set ready (less optimized but functional)

   - Version: v1

### "Production is behind schedule"
